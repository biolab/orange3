<!--
Squash the commits, as appropriate. See .github/CONTRIBUTING.md for
more information.

Describe the relevant changes in the commit messages, if they need explaining.
 
If the pull request introduces a new feature or an important bug fix, consider
adding _one_ of the below tags, enclosed in square brackets, in its title:

    ENH, FIX, DOC, WIP

For some example:

    [ENH] CrossValidation: Parallelize computation
    [FIX] NaiveBayesLearner: Don't crash on input containing nan values
    [DOC] Extend documentation for widget development
    [WIP] Working on X ... RFC please

Pull-requests not so tagged will be batched as "other features and bugfixes,"
which is fine for stuff you don't go home and brag to your mother about.
