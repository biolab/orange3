"""
This configuration use sphinx-multiproject which builds multiple
Sphinx projects for the Read the Docs. We publish each project at read-the-docs
as orange3 RTD project's subproject. This config file is only required for the
Read the Docs build. Each documentation project can still be built separately
with sphinx-build (make html).

To select a documentation project that the RTD will build, set the PROJECT
environment variable in RTD subprojects to the documentation project name
(e.g. PROJECT=data-mining-library)

To test the documentation build locally run (from doc directory):
```
PROJECT="<project name>" sphinx-build . ./_build
```
