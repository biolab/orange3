Linear Projection
=================

.. figure:: icons/linear-projection.png

A linear projection method with explorative data analysis.

Signals
-------

**Inputs**:

-  **Data**

   An input data set

-  **Data Subset**

   A subset of data instances

-  **Projection**

   Custom projection vectors

**Outputs**:

-  **Selected Data**

   A data subset that the user has manually selected in the projection.

-  **Data**

   Data with an additional column showing whether a point is selected. If more
   than one group is selected then also the group name is written instead.

-  **Components**

   Projection vectors



Description
-----------

This widget displays `linear projections <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(linear_algebra)>`_
of class-labeled data. It supports various types of projections such as circular,
`linear discriminant analysis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis>`_,
`principal component analysis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis>`_,
custom projection.

Consider, for a start, a projection of the *Iris*
data set shown below. Notice that it is the sepal width and sepal length
that already separate *Iris setosa* from the other two, while the petal
length is the attribute best separating *Iris versicolor* from *Iris
virginica*.

1. Axes in the projection that are displayed and other available axes.
2. Optimize your projection by using **Suggest Features**. This feature
   scores attributes by average classification accuracy and returns the
   top scoring attributes with a simultaneous visualization update.

3. Choose the type of projection.
4. Axes inside a circle are hidden. Circle radius can be be changed using a slider.
5. Adjust *plot properties*:

   -  Set `jittering <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitter>`_ to prevent the dots from
      overlapping (especially for discrete attributes).

   -  *Show legend* displays a legend on the right. Click and drag the legend to move it.

   -  *Show class density* colors the graph by class (see the screenshot below).

   -  *Label only selected points* allows you to select individual data instances and label them.

6. *Select, zoom, pan* and *zoom to fit* are the options for exploring the graph.
   Manual selection of data instances works as an angular/square
   selection tool. Double click to move the projection. Scroll in or out
   for zoom.
7. If *Send automatically* is ticked, changes are communicated automatically.
   Alternatively, press *Send*.
8. *Save Image* saves the created image to your computer in a .svg or .png
   format.
   Produce a report.

Example
-------

The **Linear Projection** widget works just like other visualization widgets. Below,
we connected it to the :doc:`File <../data/file>` widget to see the set projected on a 2-D
plane. Then we selected the data for further analysis and connected it
to the :doc:`Data Table <../data/datatable>` widget to see the details of the selected subset.
