Silhouette Plot
===============

A graphical representation of consistency within clusters of data. 

Inputs
    Data
        input dataset

Outputs
    Selected Data
        instances selected from the plot
    Data
        data with an additional column showing whether a point is selected


The **Silhouette Plot** widget offers a graphical representation of consistency within clusters of data and provides the user with the means to visually assess cluster quality. The silhouette score is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster in comparison to other clusters and is crucial in the creation of a silhouette plot. The silhouette score close to 1 indicates that the data instance is close to the center of the cluster and instances possessing the silhouette scores close to 0 are on the border between two clusters.

1. Choose the distance metric. You can choose between:

   -  `Euclidean <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance>`_ ("straight line" distance between two points)
   -  `Manhattan <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance>`_ (the sum of absolute differences for all attributes)
   -  `Cosine <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity>`_ (1 - cosine of the angle between two vectors)

2. Select the cluster label. You can decide whether to group the instances by cluster or not.
3. Display options:

   -  *Choose bar width*.
   -  *Annotations*: annotate the silhouette plot. 

4. *Save Image* saves the created silhouette plot to your computer in a *.png* or *.svg* format.
5. Produce a report.
6. Output:

   -  *Add silhouette scores* (good clusters have higher silhouette scores)
   -  By clicking *Commit*, changes are communicated to the output of the widget. Alternatively, tick the box on the left and changes will be communicated automatically. 

7. The created silhouette plot. 

Example
-------

In the snapshot below, we have decided to use the **Silhouette Plot** on the *iris* dataset. We selected data instances with low silhouette scores and passed them on as a subset to the :doc:`Scatter Plot <../visualize/scatterplot>` widget. This visualization only confirms the accuracy of the **Silhouette Plot** widget, as you can clearly see that the subset lies in the border between two clusters.
