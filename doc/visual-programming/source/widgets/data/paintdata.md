Paint Data
==========

Paints data on a 2D plane. You can place individual data points or use a brush to paint larger datasets.

**Outputs**

- Data: dataset as painted in the plot

The widget supports the creation of a new dataset by visually placing data points on a two-dimension plane. Data points can be placed on the plane individually (*Put*) or in a larger number by brushing (*Brush*). Data points can belong to classes if the data is intended to be used in supervised learning.

1. Name the axes and select a class to paint data instances. The checkbox at Variable Y allows to output 2D or 1D data. Below, you can add or remove classes. Use only one class to create classless, unsupervised datasets.
2. Drawing tools. Paint data points with *Brush* (multiple data instances) or *Put* (individual data instance). Select data points with *Select* and remove them with the Delete/Backspace key. Reposition data points with [Jitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitter) (spread) and *Magnet* (focus). Use *Clear* to erase all points. Below, set the radius and intensity for the Brush, Put, Jitter and Magnet tools or change the symbol size.
3. Reset to Input Data.
4. Tick the box on the left to automatically commit changes. Alternatively, press *Send* to apply them.
5. Produce a report.

Example
-------

In the example below, we have painted a dataset with 4 classes. Such dataset is great for demonstrating k-means and hierarchical clustering methods. In the screenshot, we see that [k-Means](../unsupervised/kmeans.md), overall, recognizes clusters better than [Hierarchical Clustering](../unsupervised/hierarchicalclustering.md). It returns a score rank, where the best score (the one with the highest value) means the most likely number of clusters. Hierarchical clustering, however, doesnâ€™t group the right classes together. This is a great tool for learning and exploring statistical concepts.
