Tests learning algorithms on data.

Signals
-------

**Inputs**:

- **Data**

  Data for training and, if there is no separate test data set, also testing.

- **Test Data**

  Separate data for testing.

- **Learner**

  One or more learning algorithms.

**Outputs**:

- **Evaluation results**

  Results of testing the algorithms.

Description
-----------

The widget tests learning algorithms. Different sampling schemes
are available, including using separate test data. The widget does two
things. First, it shows a table with different classifier performance measures,
such as [classification accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision) and [area under ROC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_the_curve).
Second, it outputs evaluation results, which can be used by other widgets
for analyzing the performance of classifiers, such as **ROC Analysis** or
**Confusion Matrix**.

*Learner* signal has an uncommon property: it can be
connected to more than one widgetto test multiple learners with the same procedures.

1. The widget supports various sampling methods.
  - [**Cross-validation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)) splits the data into a given number of folds (usually 5 or 10).
    The algorithm is tested by holding out examples from one fold at a time; the model
    is induced from other folds and examples from the held out fold
    are classified. This is repeated for all the folds.
  - **Leave-one-out** is similar, but it holds out one instance
    at a time, inducing the model from all others and then classifying the 
    held out instances. This method is obviously very stable, reliableâ€¦ and very
    slow.
  - **Random sampling** randomly splits the data into the training and
    testing set in the given proportion (e.g. 70:30); the whole procedure is
    repeated for a specified number of times.
  - **Test on train data** uses
    the whole data set for training and then for testing. This method
    practically always gives wrong results.
  - **Test on test data**: the above methods use the data from *Data* signal only. To input another
    data set with testing examples (for instance from another file or some
    data selected in another widget), we select *Separate
    Test Data* signal in the communication channel and select Test on test data.

2. Press *Apply* to apply the changes.

3. Only *Test on test data* requires a target class, e.g. having the disease or being of subvariety *Iris setosa*.
  When *Target class* is (None), methods return the average value. Target class can be selected at the bottom of the widget.

4. The widget will compute a number of performance statistics.
  - [**Area under ROC**](http://gim.unmc.edu/dxtests/roc3.htm) is the area under receiver-operating curve.
  - [**Classification accuracy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision) is the proportion of correctly classified examples.
  - [**F-1**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) is a weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall (see below).
  - [**Precision**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) is the proportion of true positives among instances classified as positive, e.g. the proportion of *Iris virginica* correctly identified as Iris virginica.
  - [**Recall**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) is the proportion of true positives among all positive instances in the data, e.g. the number of sick among all diagnosed as sick.

Example
-------

In a typical use of the widget, we give it a data set and a few learning
algorithms and we observe their performance in the table inside the
**Test & Score** widget and in the **ROC**. The data is often preprocessed before testing; in
this case we did some manual feature selection (**Select Columns** widget) on *Titanic* data set, where
we want to know only the sex and status of the survived and omit the age.

Another example of using this widget is presented in the documentation for **Confusion Matrix** widget.
