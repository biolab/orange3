class Distance:
    """
    Base class for construction of distances models (:obj:`DistanceModel`).

    Distances can be computed between all pairs of rows in one table, or
    between pairs where one row is from one table and one from another.

    If `axis` is set to `0`, the class computes distances between all pairs
    of columns in a table. Distances between columns from separate tables are
    probably meaningless, thus unsupported.

    The class can be used as follows:

    - Constructor is called only with keyword argument `axis` that
      specifies the axis over which the distances are computed, and with other
      subclass-specific keyword arguments.
    - Next, we call the method `fit(data)` to produce an instance of
      :obj:`DistanceModel`; the instance stores any parameters needed for
      computation of distances, such as statistics for normalization and
      handling of missing data.
    - We can then call the :obj:`DistanceModel` with data to compute the
      distance between its rows or columns, or with two data tables to
      compute distances between all pairs of rows.

    The second, shorter way to use this class is to call the constructor with
    one or two data tables and any additional keyword arguments. Constructor
    will execute the above steps and return :obj:`~Orange.misc.DistMatrix`.
    Such usage is here for backward compatibility, practicality and efficiency.

    Args:
        e1 (:obj:`~Orange.data.Table` or :obj:`~Orange.data.Instance` or \
                :obj:`np.ndarray` or `None`):
            data on which to train the model and compute the distances
        e2 (:obj:`~Orange.data.Table` or :obj:`~Orange.data.Instance` or \
                :obj:`np.ndarray` or `None`):
            if present, the class computes distances with pairs coming from
            the two tables
        axis (int):
            axis over which the distances are computed, 1 (default) for
            rows, 0 for columns
        impute (bool):
            if `True` (default is `False`), nans in the computed distances
            are replaced with zeros, and infs with very large numbers.

    Attributes:
        axis (int):
            axis over which the distances are computed, 1 (default) for
            rows, 0 for columns
        impute (bool):
            if `True` (default is `False`), nans in the computed distances
            are replaced with zeros, and infs with very large numbers.

    The capabilities of the metrics are described with class attributes.

    If class attribute `supports_discrete` is `True`, the distance
    also uses discrete attributes to compute row distances. The use of discrete
    attributes depends upon the type of distance; e.g. Jaccard distance observes
    whether the value is zero or non-zero, while Euclidean and Manhattan
    distance observes whether a pair of values is same or different.

    Class attribute `supports_missing` indicates that the distance can cope
    with missing data. In such cases, letting the distance handle it should
    be preferred over pre-imputation of missing values.

    Class attribute `supports_normalization` indicates that the constructor
    accepts an argument `normalize`. If set to `True`, the metric will attempt
    to normalize the values in a sense that each attribute will have equal
    influence. For instance, the Euclidean distance subtract the mean and
    divides the result by the deviation, while Manhattan distance uses the
    median and MAD.

    If class attribute `supports_sparse` is `True`, the class will handle
    sparse data. Currently, all classes that do handle it rely on fallbacks to
    SKL metrics. These, however, do not support discrete data and missing
    values, and will fail silently.
