        """Louvain clustering for community detection in graphs.

        Louvain clustering is a community detection algorithm for detecting
        clusters of "communities" in graphs. As such, tabular data must first
        be converted into graph form. This is typically done by computing the
        KNN graph on the input data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        k_neighbors : Optional[int]
            The number of nearest neighbors to use for the KNN graph if
            tabular data is passed.

        metric : Optional[str]
            The metric to use to compute the nearest neighbors.

        resolution : Optional[float]
            The resolution is a parameter of the Louvain method that affects
            the size of the recovered clusters.

        random_state: Union[int, RandomState]
            The random state parameter follows the convention used in scikit-learn.
            If the value is an int, random_state is the seed used by the random
            number generator. If the value is a RandomState instance, then it will
            be used as the random number generator. If the value is None, the random
            number generator is the RandomState instance used by `np.random`.
