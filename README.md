# Orange Data Mining
[Orange] is a data mining and visualization toolbox for novice and expert alike. To explore data with Orange, one requires __no programming or in-depth mathematical knowledge__. We believe that workflow-based data science tools democratize data science by hiding complex underlying mechanics and exposing intuitive concepts. Anyone who owns data, or is motivated to peek into data, should have the means to do so.

## Installing

### Easy installation

For easy installation, [Download](https://orange.biolab.si/download) the latest released Orange version from our website. To install an add-on, head to `Options -> Add-ons...` in the menu bar.

### Installing with Conda

First, install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for your OS. 

Then, create a new conda environment, and install orange3:

```Shell
# Add conda-forge to your channels for access to the latest release
conda config --add channels conda-forge

# Perhaps enforce strict conda-forge priority
conda config --set channel_priority strict

# Create and activate an environment for Orange
conda create python=3.10 --yes --name orange3
conda activate orange3

# Install Orange
conda install orange3
```

For installation of an add-on, use:
```Shell
conda install orange3-<addon name>
```
[See specific add-on repositories for details.](https://github.com/biolab/)


### Installing with pip

We recommend using our [standalone installer](https://orange.biolab.si/download) or conda, but Orange is also installable with pip. You will need a C/C++ compiler (on Windows we suggest using Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools).
Orange needs PyQt to run. Install either:
- PyQt5 and PyQtWebEngine: `pip install -r requirements-pyqt.txt` 
- PyQt6 and PyQt6-WebEngine: `pip install PyQt6 PyQt6-WebEngine`

### Installing with winget (Windows only)

To install Orange with [winget](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/), run:

```Shell
winget install --id  UniversityofLjubljana.Orange 
```

## Running

Ensure you've activated the correct virtual environment. If following the above conda instructions:

```Shell
conda activate orange3
``` 

Run `orange-canvas` or `python3 -m Orange.canvas`. Add `--help` for a list of program options.

Starting up for the first time may take a while.

Want to get involved? Join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/FWrfeXV), introduce yourself in #general! 

Take a look at our [contributing guide](https://github.com/irgolic/orange3/blob/README-shields/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [style guidelines](https://github.com/biolab/orange-widget-base/wiki/Widget-UI).

Check out our widget development [docs](https://orange-widget-base.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) for a comprehensive guide on writing Orange widgets.

### The Orange ecosystem

The development of core Orange is primarily split into three repositories:

[biolab/orange-canvas-core](https://www.github.com/biolab/orange-canvas-core) implements the canvas,  
[biolab/orange-widget-base](https://www.github.com/biolab/orange-widget-base) is a handy widget GUI library,  
[biolab/orange3](https://www.github.com/biolab/orange3) brings it all together and implements the base data mining toolbox.	

Additionally, add-ons implement additional widgets for more specific use cases. [Anyone can write an add-on.](https://github.com/biolab/orange3-example-addon) Some of our first-party add-ons:

- [biolab/orange3-text](https://www.github.com/biolab/orange3-text)
- [biolab/orange3-bioinformatics](https://www.github.com/biolab/orange3-bioinformatics)
- [biolab/orange3-timeseries](https://www.github.com/biolab/orange3-timeseries)    
- [biolab/orange3-single-cell](https://www.github.com/biolab/orange3-single-cell)    
- [biolab/orange3-imageanalytics](https://www.github.com/biolab/orange3-imageanalytics)    
- [biolab/orange3-educational](https://www.github.com/biolab/orange3-educational)    
- [biolab/orange3-geo](https://www.github.com/biolab/orange3-geo)    
- [biolab/orange3-associate](https://www.github.com/biolab/orange3-associate)    
- [biolab/orange3-network](https://www.github.com/biolab/orange3-network)
- [biolab/orange3-explain](https://www.github.com/biolab/orange3-explain)

### Setting up for core Orange development

First, fork the repository by pressing the fork button in the top-right corner of this page.

Set your GitHub username,

```Shell
export MY_GITHUB_USERNAME=replaceme
```

create a conda environment, clone your fork, and install it:

```Shell
conda create python=3.10 --yes --name orange3
conda activate orange3

git clone ssh://git@github.com/$MY_GITHUB_USERNAME/orange3

# Install PyQT and PyQtWebEngine. You can also use PyQt6
pip install -r orange3/requirements-pyqt.txt
pip install -e orange3
```

Now you're ready to work with git. See GitHub's guides on [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests), [forks](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/working-with-forks) if you're unfamiliar. If you're having trouble, get in touch on [Discord](https://discord.gg/FWrfeXV).

#### Running

Run Orange with `python -m Orange.canvas` (after activating the conda environment).

`python -m Orange.canvas -l 2 --no-splash --no-welcome` will skip the splash screen and welcome window, and output more debug info. Use `-l 4` for more.

Add `--clear-widget-settings` to clear the widget settings before start.

To explore the dark side of the Orange, try `--style=fusion:breeze-dark`

Argument `--help` lists all available options.

To run tests, use `unittest Orange.tests Orange.widgets.tests`


### Setting up for development of all components

Should you wish to contribute Orange's base components (the widget base and the canvas), you must also clone these two repositories from Github instead of installing them as dependencies of Orange3.

First, fork all the repositories to which you want to contribute. 

Set your GitHub username,

```Shell
export MY_GITHUB_USERNAME=replaceme
```

create a conda environment, clone your forks, and install them:

```Shell
conda create python=3.10 --yes --name orange3
conda activate orange3

# Install PyQT and PyQtWebEngine. You can also use PyQt6
pip install -r requirements-pyqt.txt

git clone ssh://git@github.com/$MY_GITHUB_USERNAME/orange-widget-base
pip install -e orange-widget-base

git clone ssh://git@github.com/$MY_GITHUB_USERNAME/orange-canvas-core
pip install -e orange-canvas-core

git clone ssh://git@github.com/$MY_GITHUB_USERNAME/orange3
pip install -e orange3

# Repeat for any add-on repositories
```

It's crucial to install `orange-base-widget` and `orange-canvas-core` before `orange3` to ensure that `orange3` will use your local versions.
